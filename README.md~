Tic-tac-toe
=========


I have recreated the classic game of [Tic-tac-toe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe). This is a game between human vs computer. The objective of the program is to implement the artificial intelligence (AI) of the computer player using an algorithm based on Reinforcement Learning.

The concept of this game is based from "Reinforcement Learning, An Introduction" by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto. 

System Requirements: Python 2.7 or higher version
